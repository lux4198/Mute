# Mute_and_Skip_YT_Ads

## About 

This Chrome extension automatically mutes YouTube ads or skips them if possible. When the video starts it will unmute again. You also don't have to wait the 
5 seconds to skip the ad, the extension will skip it as soon as it shows up. 
Since a lot of ads are very shrill and annoying I found this very helpful if you don't want to get some ad involuntarily stuck in your head.
