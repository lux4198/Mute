# Mute_and_Skip_YT_Ads

## About 

This Chrome extension automatically mutes YouTube ads or skips them if possible. When the video starts it will unmute again. You also don't have to wait the 
5 seconds to skip the ad, the extension will skip it as soon as it shows up. 
Since a lot of ads are very shrill and annoying I found this very helpful if you don't want to get some ad involuntarily stuck in your head. 

## Run the Extension 

If you want to run this extension in a chrome browser: 

1. Clone the Repository and save the folder to your local machine. 
2. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/. 
3. Activate Developer Mode (top right corner)   
4. Go to Load Unpacked and load the folder containing the extension. 
5. Activate extension and you're good to go. 

The Extension will only run on youtube.com* urls. Have fun :)
